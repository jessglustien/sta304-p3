# Estimating the 2020 US Presidential Election

On November 3, 2020, Americans will go to the polls to elect their next President. Republican incumbent Donald Trump is seeking re-election against Democratic Nominee and former Vice-President Joe Biden. In this paper, we strive to answer one question, who will win one of the most contested presidential elections in history? In service of this goal, we employ three logistic regression models with post-stratification. Comparing these three results, we determine there is no clear winner of the popular vote, and undecided voters will play a large role in the outcome. Code and data supporting this analysis are available in this repository.
